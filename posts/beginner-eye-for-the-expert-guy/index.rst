When I first installed linux I went through a phase of starting everything from a terminal ("lookit me, I'm a hacker!"), and *every friggin one of them* filled the screen with:

.. code::

  Info:  Invalid doohickey.
  Warning:  Something bad is happening, just fyi.
  Attempting to recover... failed.
  Limping on valiantly.
  Warning:  Doohickey appears to be growing fangs.

  DOOHICKEY:  YOAR COMPUTER ARE BELONGE TO ME NOW
  Info:  Emergency shunting from main loop in order to save humanity.  Tell my wife I love her.
  Thanks for using VLC!

Watching those poor mutilated programs flailing helplessly away at each other in my RAM, I wondered how my computer could function at all.  Now, of course, I ignore the pathetic cries for help unless something actually goes wrong.

I think this transition explains the saying, "can do, can't teach".

.. TEASER_END

It's a weird idea, if you think about it.  A fat wallet does not make you worse at buying your friends a beer.  Why should expertise make you worse at teaching?  And yet that often seems to be how it works out.

I've experienced it myself:

.. code::

  Me:       So now, type in your friend's email address.
  Student:  It's not working.  I'm typing but nothing's happening.
  Me:       Oh.  Sorry.  First you've got to click on the address field.  
            See how there's no cursor there?
  Student:  Ok, I put the cursor there, but it's still not working.
  Me:       You've got the mouse over the field, now you just have to click.
  Student:  Which letter?

.. code::

  Me:       ... and none of your pieces are threatened, so you can develop -
  Student:  You could capture this pawn, couldn't you?
  Me:       No.
  Student:  The queen can move on a slant, right?
  Me:       Oh.  Yeah.  But the pawn's protected.  I'd lose my queen.

I am **not** making fun of the student in either of these stories.  They're both very intelligent people who happen to be meeting these ideas for the first time.  They're doing exactly what a learner should be doing - looking at the information they have, and using it to form hypotheses.  

The failure is with me.  I have used a mouse and captured chess pieces so many times, my brain has abstracted out the logic and registered it as a callback on the appropriate events.  I don't even remember the details any more, it just happens.  And that hinders my ability to teach.

Beginners need to spend time on details - that's the only way they can get their callbacks registered.  A skilled teacher can help them go through that process more quickly, but it can't be skipped.
