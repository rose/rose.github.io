This is the first time in this whole experiment that I've been tempted to skip a day.  A lot happened today, some of it expected, some not, and now it's 11:40 and I got nothing.  I can barely write my name in 20 minutes, let alone a lengthy and heartfelt dirty joke about C++.

Here's a poem instead:

.. code::

  I start a limer-
  ick sometimes / but often can't
  get all the rhymes. /  An
  idea hits! / I'll pretend 
  that it's / really a tanka

Code tomorrow.
