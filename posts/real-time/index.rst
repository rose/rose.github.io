I don't understand how software companies schedule jobs at all.  Anything a programmer knows how to do, she automates.  By definition, the remaining work involves flailing desperately across a sea of poor documentation and broken dreams, wearing the cement shoes of our own ignorance.

This summer I did a short contract, for which I had to track my time.  Here's a log excerpt for a typical 5 minute task: 

.. code::

  8:00 - try easy straightforward thing that will definitely work in less than 5 minutes
  8:03 - wtf
  8:04 - google
  8:18 - try stack overflow solution that worked for 687 other people
  8:20 - WTF
  8:26 - reboot server
  8:31 - google
  8:38 - reinstall python
  8:53 - read documentation of all software involved in easy straightforward thing
  10:18 - reinstall grub
  11:27 - read source code of all software involved in easy straightforward thing
  16:87 - WHY IS THIS HAPPENING TO ME 16:87 ISN'T EVEN A REAL TIME
  1:32 - try easy thing that I tried at 8:00
  1:33 - it worked.  W.  Tf.
  1:34 - sooo... how many hours should I bill for this?
