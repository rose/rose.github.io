<p>I was talking with Gargravarr <a class="footnote-reference" href="../../posts/the-write-stuff/#id3" id="id1">[1]</a> recently about writing, and he asked how much work I put into my blog posts.  The answer is a lot.  I treat instant messages like emails, emails like term papers, term papers like Master's theses, and Master's theses like - well, who knows.  I'm a little high strung, is what I'm saying.</p>
<p>My first drafts usually look like this:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block">
Hah, C++ is weird.  And javascript.  But they're different.

My favourite chocolate bar used to be Snickers, but I now I don't like them as much, and

Forth something something (dick joke?)

One really clever sentence for beginning a blog post is

Dammit.
</pre>
<p>Used to be I'd give up around here, because how the hell is that going to turn into anything that anyone would want to read?</p>
<!-- TEASER_END -->
<p>But later in the conversation, we were talking about debugging, and he said something that really struck a nerve:</p>
<blockquote>
... this is one area where having some experience helps. Sometimes it's because it gives you ideas, but mostly because you know you're going to win if you keep going.</blockquote>
<p>You know you're going to win if you keep going.  Well said, Gargravarr.  That's exactly what it is.  In high school I had interesting ideas, a decent vocabulary, and good taste.  But I was convinced that there was some method, some trick, some strategy that would infallibly, instantly crystallize a beautiful snowflake out of my drifting cloud of idea droplets.  And I didn't know that trick, so I couldn't write.</p>
<p>Over a period of many years, I avoided writing like the plaque. <a class="footnote-reference" href="../../posts/the-write-stuff/#id4" id="id2">[2]</a>  But, out of sheer necessity, I would sometimes have to go through the agony of producing some sort of written material - and what I came up with on those occasions was usually, much to my astonishment, reasonably good.</p>
<p>I eventually figured out that this was not luck.  The magic trick I had been searching for didn't exist - writing is just a matter of sitting down with a bunch of mud, and playing with it until it turns into a serviceable pot.  Now that I have faith that I can do this, it is not painful at all (though it still takes longer than I would like).</p>
