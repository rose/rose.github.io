Moose is an extremely popular module which adds more extensive support for object oriented programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know anything about Moose or its history, but I figured I could write something anyway, making educated guesses about how things went down. &lt;a class="footnote-reference" href="http://rose.github.io/posts/keeping-perl-classy/#id9" id="id1"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;  Fortunately haarg came along and sacrificed an hour of his time to save us all from that.  Here's some stuff we typed at each other, with minor rearrangements and editing to make me look literate.
