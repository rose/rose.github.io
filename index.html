<p>So, the dilemma facing me this morning was, should I just post a cheesy poem, or try to write some (inevitably crappy) code?  Fortunately my friends pointed out that these two choices are not mutually exclusive.</p>

        <div><p>They say life is what happens while you're busy making other plans, and so it is in programming.</p>
<p>I've spent my time as a programmer merrily bouncing from language to language ("Forth!  Oooh, Haskell... no, assembly!").  But in the meantime, Python was casually easing its way more and more into my brain and fingers.  So many moocs require it, so many blog posts use it for examples, so many of my friends know it.  Over the last few months I've resigned myself to the fact that it has become my strongest language.</p>
<p>I don't mean to sound unkind.  Python's a fine language.  It's the vodka of programming languages - powerful, convenient, mixes well with a lot of things.  If Point B is processed data and a lampshade on your head, Python and vodka will get you there.  But I can't shake the feeling that they're both a little <em>bland</em>.</p>

<p>You have to understand that I did not always enjoy writing.  The key, as is so often the case, lies in the brain of my eight-year-old self.</p>
<p>I had been reading intensively since I was 4, and the first few times I tried to put a story down on paper were absolutely horrifying.  I could see the vast gulf between what I had produced and what I would be willing to consume, but I didn't have the skills or maturity to bridge that gulf.  The constant gold stars and head patting I got in math were much more appealing, so I decided that writing was not a thing I was going to do.</p>
<p>And I was stubborn enough to get away with this for a long time.  Teachers don't always like stubborn kids, but they <em>love</em> quiet kids who get excited about books.</p>

        <div class="p-summary">
        <div><p>A friend suggested, perhaps facetiously, that I should do a post on incrementation.  It took me down some surprisingly interesting roads; of them all, here's my favourite.</p>
<p>There are a number of implementations of Peano numbers in C++ templates, <a class="footnote-reference" href="posts/incremental-complexity/#id4" id="id1">[1]</a> but most of them use ints in some form or other, for example:</p>
<pre class="code c++ literal-block">
<span class="k">struct</span> <span class="n">Zero</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="k">enum</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="n">value</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span> <span class="p">};</span> <span class="p">};</span>

<span class="k">template</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="k">typename</span> <span class="n">N</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
<span class="k">struct</span> <span class="n">Succ</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="k">enum</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="n">value</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">N</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">value</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="p">};</span> <span class="p">};</span>
</pre>
<p>This is fine as far as it goes, but it's still explicitly depending on the computer's ability to do arithmetic on ints.  If you're going to type the characters "+ 1" anyway, you might as well give up and use python.  I prefer the following:</p>
<pre class="code c++ literal-block">
<span class="k">struct</span> <span class="n">Zero</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="p">};</span>

<span class="k">template</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">P</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
<span class="k">struct</span> <span class="n">Succ</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="p">};</span>
</pre>
<p>This shows what's happening much more clearly.  We're not using numbers to define incrementation; we're <strong>using incrementation to define numbers</strong>.  Let's see what we can do with these numbers...</p>

<p>You probably know why this is terrible.  If you've never encountered exponential runtime before, try running this on increasing numbers - it's pretty eye-opening.</p>
<pre class="code python literal-block">
<span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">i</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="nb">range</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">51</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">):</span>

</pre>
<p>On my computer, the values up to 25 print instantly.  30 takes a noticeable fraction of a second, 35 a couple of seconds... and 40 maxes out one of my processors until I get bored and kill it.  Even if your computer and your attention span are both twice as good as mine, I bet you don't sit through fib(50).</p>
<p>Now, it's not too much trouble to write a better fib; we could make it iterative, or store and look up previously calculated values.  But this is an example of a more general problem - what if this was a big hairy function we didn't want to mess around with?  Or if we had 100 small functions with the same issue?</p>
