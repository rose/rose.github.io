<p>A couple days ago I wrote <a class="reference external" href="posts/starting-with-a-bang/">a post</a> about bash's history completion.  It has since been brought to my attention that lesser programmers are in the habit of making "mistakes" when typing commands.  This post is dedicated to those unfortunate souls.</p>
<p>If you're unsure what a history expansion will do, you can have bash print it out:</p>
<pre class="code console literal-block">
<span class="gp">$</span> touch !-3*:p  <span class="c"># recall that !-3* is the arguments of the third most recent command.
</span><span class="go">                # the new command is echoed but *not* run
touch king of the world</span>
</pre>
<p>The expanded line will be added to your history even though it wasn't run, so if it's what you wanted you can run it with !!.  If it's close but not quite right, hit up or ^P to edit it.</p>

<p>I mentioned a couple days ago that I look forward to writing a compiler 'someday'.  Well, in the spirit of Failure Month, let's lower our sights enough that we can s/some/to.  Let's just see how much of a class system we can put together.  In this post, we'll get method binding working properly, and in a future one we'll look at inheritance.</p>
<p>To avoid muddying the waters with the implementation language's classes, we'll use one that doesn't have any - javascript.  We'll avoid the dark corners &amp; just work with functions and hash tables, so if you know any scripting language you should be able to follow this fine. <a class="footnote-reference" href="posts/methodical-bondage/#id4" id="id1">[1]</a></p>
<p>Let's start without methods, and just get attribute lookups happening.  We want to build the backend compilery bits that implement this sort of functionality:</p>
<pre class="code python literal-block">
<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Foo</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="c"># make a class</span>
  <span class="n">boop</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">3</span> <span class="c"># instances of this class have an attribute boop, which by default is 3</span>

<span class="n">f</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Foo</span><span class="p">()</span>  <span class="c"># make an instance of the class</span>
<span class="n">f2</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Foo</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="c"># and another one</span>

<span class="n">f</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">boop</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">7</span> <span class="c"># set f's attribute boop to 7</span>

<span class="k">print</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">f</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">boop</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c"># get f's attribute boop, which is now 7</span>
<span class="k">print</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">f2</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">boop</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c"># 3; f2's boop is undefined, so we get the class value, which is not changed</span>
</pre>
<p>We're not bothering with the frontend compilery bits, so we won't have that nice syntax to work with.  Instead, we'll test by calling the backend functions directly in javascript.  So the equivalent of the code above will look something like:</p>
<pre class="code javascript literal-block">
<span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">Foo</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">make_class</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nx">boop</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">});</span>

<span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">f</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">instantiate_class</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">Foo</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">f2</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">instantiate_class</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">Foo</span><span class="p">);</span>

<span class="nx">set_attr</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">f</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'boop'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">7</span><span class="p">);</span>

<span class="c1">// console.log is the javascript equivalent of print
</span><span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"This should be 7: "</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">get_attr</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">f</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'boop'</span><span class="p">));</span>
<span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"This should be 3: "</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">get_attr</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">f2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'boop'</span><span class="p">));</span>
</pre>
<p>After these functions are defined, then we can get to the good stuff.  Excited?</p>

<p>Yesterday's post went a lot longer than I expected, leaving me with a lot to get done today.  So, I wanted to do something short.  Unfortunately, I'm also aiming to alternate code/non-code articles, and code articles can take a while to do even passably well.</p>
<p>So, the dilemma facing me this morning was, should I just post a cheesy poem, or try to write some (inevitably crappy) code?  Fortunately my friends pointed out that these two choices are not mutually exclusive.</p>

<p>They say life is what happens while you're busy making other plans, and so it is in programming.</p>
<p>I've spent my time as a programmer merrily bouncing from language to language ("Forth!  Oooh, Haskell... no, assembly!").  But in the meantime, Python was casually easing its way more and more into my brain and fingers.  So many moocs require it, so many blog posts use it for examples, so many of my friends know it.  Over the last few months I've resigned myself to the fact that it has become my strongest language.</p>
<p>I don't mean to sound unkind.  Python's a fine language.  It's the vodka of programming languages - powerful, convenient, mixes well with a lot of things.  If Point B is processed data and a lampshade on your head, Python and vodka will get you there.  But I can't shake the feeling that they're both a little <em>bland</em>.</p>

<p>I like writing, I like programming, I like writing about programming.  So why haven't I been blogging?</p>
<p>You have to understand that I did not always enjoy writing.  The key, as is so often the case, lies in the brain of my eight-year-old self.</p>
<p>I had been reading intensively since I was 4, and the first few times I tried to put a story down on paper were absolutely horrifying.  I could see the vast gulf between what I had produced and what I would be willing to consume, but I didn't have the skills or maturity to bridge that gulf.  The constant gold stars and head patting I got in math were much more appealing, so I decided that writing was not a thing I was going to do.</p>
<p>And I was stubborn enough to get away with this for a long time.  Teachers don't always like stubborn kids, but they <em>love</em> quiet kids who get excited about books.</p>
