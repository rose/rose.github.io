<p>A while back I <a class="reference external" href="posts/methodical-bondage/">promised</a> to add inheritance to the quick-n-dirty 'classes' I wrote in javascript.  But, I realized that this requires some background on the problems that can arise with multiple inheritance.  So, let's look at how this works in Python, and then we'll implement the algorithm in a later post.</p>
<p>Recall that inheritance is a way to find attributes on an object that the object and its class do not have themselves.  We can think of it as getting advice from a friend:</p>
<pre class="code python literal-block">
<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Carol</span><span class="p">:</span>
  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">hide_body</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="s">"Carol says:  I think there's still room in the root cellar."</span>

<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Bob</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Carol</span><span class="p">):</span>
  <span class="k">pass</span>

<span class="n">bob</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Bob</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="k">print</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">bob</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">hide_body</span><span class="p">())</span> <span class="c"># "Carol says:  I think there's still room in the root cellar."</span>
</pre>
<p><em>note: these code samples use Python 3.  If you're using Python 2, you should have all base classes inherit from object</em></p>
<p>Even though Bob doesn't know how to solve his basic life problems, he's ok, because Carol has his back.  Things get a little more complicated when we add more friends:</p>
<pre class="code python literal-block">
<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">James</span><span class="p">:</span>
  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">hide_body</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="s">"James says:  Just turn it over.  If it can't see the police, the police can't see it."</span>

<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Betty</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Bob</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">James</span><span class="p">):</span>
  <span class="k">pass</span>

<span class="n">betty</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Betty</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="k">print</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">betty</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">hide_body</span><span class="p">())</span>

<p>Does Betty's golf instructor end up in Carol's root cellar or not?</p>

<p>I was talking with Gargravarr <a class="footnote-reference" href="posts/the-write-stuff/#id3" id="id1">[1]</a> recently about writing, and he asked how much work I put into my blog posts.  The answer is a lot.  I treat instant messages like emails, emails like term papers, term papers like Master's theses, and Master's theses like - well, who knows.  I'm a little high strung, is what I'm saying.</p>
<p>My first drafts usually look like this:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block">
Hah, C++ is weird.  And javascript.  But they're different.

My favourite chocolate bar used to be Snickers, but I now I don't like them as much, and

Forth something something (dick joke?)

One really clever sentence for beginning a blog post is

Dammit.

<p>Knowledge is power - it's measured in wats.  That's the best line in the post, but you can keep reading if you want.</p>
<p>Javascript has a parseInt function that does what you'd expect:</p>

<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="nb">parseInt</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"3"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="mi">3</span>

<p>I lied.  Neither of these functions does what you probably think they do, at least not exactly.</p>
<pre class="code javascript literal-block">
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">'7'</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="s1">'9'</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="s1">'11'</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="s1">'13'</span><span class="p">].</span><span class="nx">map</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">parseInt</span><span class="p">)</span>

<p>A couple days ago I wrote <a class="reference external" href="posts/starting-with-a-bang/">a post</a> about bash's history completion.  It has since been brought to my attention that lesser programmers are in the habit of making "mistakes" when typing commands.  This post is dedicated to those unfortunate souls.</p>
<p>If you're unsure what a history expansion will do, you can have bash print it out:</p>
<pre class="code console literal-block">
<span class="gp">$</span> touch !-3*:p  <span class="c"># recall that !-3* is the arguments of the third most recent command.
</span><span class="go">                # the new command is echoed but *not* run
touch king of the world</span>
</pre>
<p>The expanded line will be added to your history even though it wasn't run, so if it's what you wanted you can run it with !!.  If it's close but not quite right, hit up or ^P to edit it.</p>

<p>I mentioned a couple days ago that I look forward to writing a compiler 'someday'.  Well, in the spirit of Failure Month, let's lower our sights enough that we can s/some/to.  Let's just see how much of a class system we can put together.  In this post, we'll get method binding working properly, and in a future one we'll look at inheritance.</p>
<p>To avoid muddying the waters with the implementation language's classes, we'll use one that doesn't have any - javascript.  We'll avoid the dark corners &amp; just work with functions and hash tables, so if you know any scripting language you should be able to follow this fine. <a class="footnote-reference" href="posts/methodical-bondage/#id4" id="id1">[1]</a></p>
<p>Let's start without methods, and just get attribute lookups happening.  We want to build the backend compilery bits that implement this sort of functionality:</p>

<p>We're not bothering with the frontend compilery bits, so we won't have that nice syntax to work with.  Instead, we'll test by calling the backend functions directly in javascript.  So the equivalent of the code above will look something like:</p>
<pre class="code javascript literal-block">
<span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">Foo</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">make_class</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nx">boop</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">});</span>

<span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">f</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">instantiate_class</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">Foo</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">f2</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">instantiate_class</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">Foo</span><span class="p">);</span>

<span class="nx">set_attr</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">f</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'boop'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">7</span><span class="p">);</span>

<span class="c1">// console.log is the javascript equivalent of print
</span><span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"This should be 7: "</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">get_attr</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">f</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'boop'</span><span class="p">));</span>
<span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"This should be 3: "</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">get_attr</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">f2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'boop'</span><span class="p">));</span>
</pre>
<p>After these functions are defined, then we can get to the good stuff.  Excited?</p>

<p>Oooh, a filler post consisting almost entirely of a <a class="reference external" href="http://zenpencils.com/comic/90-ira-glass-advice-for-beginners/">link</a> to an inspirational quote about why it bothers me to do a filler post consisting almost entirely of a link to an inspirational quote.  Meta!</p>
<p>A week ago I had my first patch rejected.  Not "oh we'll need a few changes" rejected; we're talking actual, outright "we do not want this code" rejected.  Ouch.</p>
